I'm interested in simulation/management games and Project Diva.

- [Paiagram](https://github.com/wensimehrp/paiagram) - application for drawing timetables and timetable diagrams.
  - checkout <https://wensimehrp.github.io/Paiagram> for an online version!
  - It also autosaves, so you don't need to manually maintain the editing state yourself. (Currently the only way to remove those autosaves is by manually clearing the cache, but don't worry -- it would be fixed soon.)
