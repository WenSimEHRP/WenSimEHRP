I'm interested in simulation/management games and Project Diva.

- [Paiagram](https://github.com/wensimehrp/paiagram) - application for drawing timetables and timetable diagrams.
  - The repo is currently private and the commit history is absolutely miserable and disastrous, though maybe I should make it public some time to save my CI minutes.
  - checkout <https://wensimehrp.github.io/Paiagram> for an online version that does _not_ work!
